Project Euler solutions
=======

Simple solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) math problems. 

The start of my long journey in becoming more fluent in using Python and programming languages in general to solve mathematical problems.

Written (mostly) in Python 3.

In some cases a mathematical explanation is included to justify code logic.
